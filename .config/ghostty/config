# Since Ghostty ships with sensible defaults for all options,
# users should only need to set options that they want to change
# from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
